# universe-in-a-box 🌌  
*A hands-on guide to cosmological simulations: N-body, hydrodynamics, and radiative transfer*

Welcome to **universe-in-a-box**, an educational resource for learning the foundations of cosmological simulations. This tutorial is designed for students, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to understand and implement the key components of large-scale structure formation: **gravity (N-body), gas dynamics (hydrodynamics), and radiation (radiative transfer)**.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- **N-body simulations**: modeling dark matter and gravitational clustering
- **Hydrodynamics**: simulating baryonic matter (gas) evolution
- **Radiative transfer (RT)**: tracking photons, reionization, and feedback processes
- **Code structure**: organizing a multi-physics simulation pipeline
- **Analysis & visualization**: interpreting results using Python tools
